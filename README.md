# Legendre-OPRF
An ARM64 arithmetic library and the Legendre PRF based distributed OPRF


Simplest way to run the experiments:
--

You can do all benchmarks by giving execution priviledges to the script `go.sh` 
`chmod +x go.sh`

This script cleans, compiles and runs the program. Make sure execution priviledges are provided for the directory. 

`./go.sh` Makes all prime sizes and runs benchmarks Legendre dOPRF

`./go.sh FAST` Makes all prime sizes with ARM64 assebly, and runs all tests and benchmark 

`./go.sh X` Makes X bit prime dOPRF, runs all tests and benchmark

`./go.sh X FAST` Makes X bit prime dOPRF with assembly, runs all tests and benchmarks

`./go.sh arith` runs the arithmetic tests

`./go.sh arith X FAST` as above with ARM64 assembly and X bit prime

---


Run `make` which will compile arithmetic tests and benchmarks for 64,128,192,256,512 bit sized prime fields, as well as the benchmarks for the Legendre dOPRF. The executables are arith64, arith128, arith192, arith256, arith512 for arithmetic tests and benchmarks, and dOPRF64, dOPRF128, dOPRF192, dOPRF256, dOPRF512 for the Legendre dOPRF.

By running `make dOPRF64` you will only compile the 64 bit prime arithmetic (and respectively for 128, 192, 256, 512)

By running `make dOPRF64 OPT_LEVEL=FAST` you will compile ARM64 assembly code which is optimised. It speeds up the multiplications, modular reduction, etc. For other prime sizes use `main128`, etc. respectively. Currently assembly is only implemented for 64 and 128 bits. (Some functions are faster without the "FAST" flag due to the compiler unwrapping some loops and speeding up some functions, which it doesn't do when compiling assembly. This only happens for cryptographically irrelevant sized primes (64) due to cache being large enough to allow the compiler to do this speedup.)

Lambda is set to 1 by default.
Change the macro LAMBDA in the dOPRF.c file to change the lambda value.

The parameters n and t are 4 and 1 by default.
Change the  macros CONST_N and CONST_T in the dOPRF.c file to change the n and t values.

The adversary is malicious by default.
Change the ADVERSARY macro in the dOPRF.c file to SEMIHONEST to change the adversarial type.
